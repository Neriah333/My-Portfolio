          About Me
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Iâ€™m deeply curious about technology and passionate about discovering
          different Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and how they
          transform business operations. I enjoy exploring the inner workings of
          various digital tools, understanding their potential, and finding ways
          they can be applied in real-world scenarios.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Beyond ERP systems, I love keeping up with the latest tech trends and
          experimenting with new platforms and tools. For me, learning is a
          continuous journey and technology is the perfect playground.
